# **_Tic-Tac-Toe_**

### You can play the game at: https://dhaya94.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

<br>

## **Overview**

This project uses a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game logic was handled purely by Vanilla JS, the DOM manipulation was implemented using **jQuery**.

## **Approach**

The **game Object** consists of various properties to handle all the in-game and post-game state variables, and various methods to check the winner, swap the turns, and making the turn for the AI.

The user can play the game in the versus mode or against the AI.
There is a score tracker which keeps records of the match results untill refreshed.

## **Game Modes**

Currently there are two modes:

1. VERSUS mode - where humans play against each other
2. EASY mode - Automatic filling of the empty grid positions selected randomly

The HARD mode is currently WIP and desired to be implemented, hence it is currently disbaled.

## **To Do**

- Developing the HARD Mode AI using the Minimax Algorithm
- Manage display of results more seamlessly, currently it is jerky
- Customise tokens instead of X and Os

## **Reflections**

I enjoyed putting together this project, making the HTML, CSS and JS working together to manage the different UI states was gratifying.

Refactoring the code to make it as "DRY" as possible was a tricky albeit enjoyable expereince.

I spent a lot of time on this project working on the HARD mode using the MiniMax logic. It was a challenging concept to grasp for me at this stage, and hence nothing to show in the form of code (to be rectified soon!), neverthless onto bigger things for now.
